Random projects of mine for educational purposes or just fun. Some highlights:

- A program that uses opencv to render arbitrary video (in binary black/white) in your terminal. Made to play Bad Apple in the terminal!
- A program that renders the Mandelbrot set in the terminal and allows you to navigate/zoom around using keyboard shortcuts
- My own shell written from scratch. Has a nice prompt, can start applications with arguments, can cd around, can use pipes (using | symbol) to pipe stdout stdin. Otherwise terrible.

Also a lot of algorithms and stuff from university that I implemented to understand it better.
